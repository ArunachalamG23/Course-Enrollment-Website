Hello everyone. I had done a project based on course enrollment platform. 
It had been done in AWS platform.I had included 9 services like 
            - EC2          -S3             -Lambda              -API Gateway             -DynamoDB
            -SNS           -ALB            -Auto Scaling Groups              -Route53
It has totally 6 subpages including home page and each has seperate css files
If you are willing to change the design,  you can modify it in css and update in HTML file
In this, it contains enrollment page where we need to enter student Id, Name, Fieldofstudy, Age, Course and e need to gice submit data
It triggers js file and api gateway and api is connected with lambda so it facilitates and run and save data in dynamodb
It also contains contact page where users need to enter name, email, message .When they click send message it automatically triggers SNS and semds the response to our mail id
